An implementation of Parrot's M0 specification[1]
Changes to the spec will be documented once the design is more stable

Build instruction:

  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make exe

Cleanup instructions:

  $ make clean
  $ make realclean

Uses clang by default - to use gcc, change all make invocations to

  $ make CC=gcc CFLAGS=-std=c99

If you want to compile as C++, try

  $ make CC=clang++ CFLAGS=-xc++

The code doesn't compile warning-free with gcc 4.5, which is probably related
to a compiler bug fixed in 4.6 (not verified); it doesn't compile at all with
g++ 4.5.

Compiling with Visual Studio needs GNU make and perl; use

  $ make gen

to generate necessary files and

  $ make list

to get the list of source files which go into the executable.

Compiling as C++ is supposed to work with Visual Studio - please file a ticket
if it doesn't.
